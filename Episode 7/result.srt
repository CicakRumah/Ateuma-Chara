1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,590
Your Highness! Alec!

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,509
Are you alright!?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,719
Something's wrong!

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,306
The wounds are turning purple?

5
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,936
Don't tell me...he was poisoned!?

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,023
What should I do...?

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,735
If it were Lily, she'd use her powers to heal him...

8
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,490
And the real Loneal might have
been able to use a potion...

9
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,037
But I can't do anything...

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,789
Alec...!

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,336
As long as you don't give up, you willfind a way.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,422
That's right, I need to think..!

13
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:53,344
f I don't give up... I just have to think..

14
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:55,972
I...

15
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,517
I want to save him!

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,900
What's going on?

17
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,319
There's some kind of light...?

18
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,826
His wounds...are disappearing...?

19
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,789
It's so warm...  What's this light...?

20
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,499
Alec!

21
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,629
Thank...goodness...

22
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,008
Loneal!

23
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,472
Where am I?

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,474
I see you're awake.

25
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,978
This is my second home.

26
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,484
Are you alright!? What about your wounds!?

27
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,529
See for yourself.

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,032
His arm... It's all healed!

29
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,662
They really healed...

30
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,291
It's all thanks to your magic.

31
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,500
Thank you.

32
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,962
Enough about me. Were you hurt?

33
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,342
Protecting you is my responsibility.

34
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,720
How about I check you over too?

35
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,640
Check me...?

36
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,976
Y-Your highness..

37
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,104
Does it hurt anywhere?

38
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,275
No... I'm fine...

39
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,613
He's just checking to see if I'm okay...

40
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,699
But his touch makes me so happy..

41
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,078
You seem fine.

42
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,455
A
I don't see anything

43
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,339
Oh my...
What do we have here?

44
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,758
Loneal

45
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,012
S-Sorry.
000

46
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,768
I tried to hold back...

47
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,229
But I don't think I can keep it up much longer.

48
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,649
I want to feel all of you..

49
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,040
Alec...

50
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,835
I can't...hold back either...

51
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,634
Then... I hope this'll make you feel even better.

52
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,222
It's my fault that you're in such a state.

53
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:48,728
So, I need to take responsibility and
make you enjoy every last minute of it.

54
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,855
It's already too much...

55
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,399
D-Don't stretch it...any more.

56
00:03:54,735 --> 00:04:01,490
If I don't loosen you up, then
it'll hurt when you take me in.

57
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:09,540
Alec can't be with a side-character like me...

58
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:18,340
But I can't be without him anymore.

59
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:27,016
I was so afraid when I thought he might die...

60
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,479
Loneal.

61
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,022
Let me see your face.

62
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,690
But he's alive... And...

63
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,860
Alec...! Alec...!

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,402
Iwanttofeelhistouchevenmore!

65
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,824
Loneal... Let's cum together.

66
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,128
What do you mean?

67
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,005
W-Well...

68
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,134
I know for a fact that he was
injured... As well as poisoned, but...

69
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,808
This morning, the prince returned to school
with Loneal, and appeared to be uninjured.

70
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,895
His wound disappeared?

71
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,566
That would be possible with the Holy
Bride's power... But who could've done it?

72
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:25,658
Seems like I found something much
more interesting than that notebook.

73
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,245
My dearest Loneal.
